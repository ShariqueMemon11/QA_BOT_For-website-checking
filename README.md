# QA Testing Bot

An automated QA testing bot for websites that detects and tests interactive elements, verifies content changes, and generates comprehensive reports.

## üîß Recent Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Interactive Element Detection
- Improved detection of clickable elements using better selectors
- Better classification of element types (buttons, links, tabs, dropdowns, etc.)
- More descriptive naming of elements for better reporting

### 2. Post-Click Content Change Detection
- Now verifies content changes after element interaction
- Uses TreeWalker to detect visible text changes
- Detects table/list content changes (rows, cards, products)
- Tracks URL changes and navigates back when needed

### 3. Load Time Measurement
- Properly measures load time between click and content change
- Reports accurate timing metrics for performance analysis
- Waits intelligently for network idle state

### 4. Element Type Classification
- Smarter rules based on HTML tags, classes, and text
- Better detection of tabs, nav links, dropdowns, and form elements
- Icon button detection with meaningful names

### 5. Table/List Content Detection
- Detects changes in table rows, product cards, and list items
- Reports the number of items before and after interaction
- Helps verify that filters and search functions work correctly

## üìã Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python run_qa_bot.py https://example.com --username user --password pass

# Test specific improvements
python qa_bot_test.py https://example.com --username user --password pass
```

## üìä Reports

The QA bot generates comprehensive reports in both HTML and Markdown formats, including:

- Interactive element inventory with types and names
- Test results showing successful and failed interactions
- Performance metrics including load times
- Content change verification
- Responsive design issues

## üöÄ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Playwright
- Rich (for console output)
- Pydantic (for data models)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîç How It Works

1. The bot navigates to the specified website and logs in
2. It scans the page for all interactive elements
3. It tests each element by clicking/interacting with it
4. It verifies content changes after each interaction
5. It generates a comprehensive report of findings

## Features

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests UI elements, responsive design, performance, accessibility, and more
- **Accurate Element Detection**: Smart identification of UI elements using advanced detection techniques
- **Interactive Element Testing**: Tests buttons, links, dropdowns, and other interactive elements
- **Responsive Design Testing**: Tests websites across different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identifies slow loading pages and other performance issues
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates HTML and Markdown reports with actionable recommendations
- **Flow-based Testing**: Create custom test flows for specific website features or user journeys

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip
- Playwright (browsers will be installed automatically)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd qa_testing_bot
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```
playwright install
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

The simplest way to use the QA bot is with the `run_qa_bot.py` script:

```bash
python run_qa_bot.py https://example.com --username your_username --password your_password
```

This will:
1. Log in to the website using the provided credentials
2. Test interactive elements (buttons, links, forms, etc.)
3. Check responsive design across different viewports
4. Identify performance issues
5. Generate a comprehensive HTML and Markdown report

### Command Line Options

```
usage: run_qa_bot.py [-h] --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD [--no-headless] [--flow FLOW] [--env {prod,uat}] url

Run QA tests with all fixes and improvements

positional arguments:
  url                  Website URL to test

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --username USERNAME  Login username
  --password PASSWORD  Login password
  --no-headless        Run with visible browser
  --flow FLOW          Name of specific flow to run
  --env {prod,uat}     Environment (prod, uat)
```

### Running Custom Flows

To run a specific test flow:

```bash
python run_qa_bot.py https://example.com --username your_username --password your_password --flow login_checkout --env uat
```

### Creating Custom Flows

Flows are defined in YAML files in the `flows/{environment}` directory. Create a new flow file with the following structure:

```yaml
name: login_checkout
description: Test login and checkout process
steps:
  - action: login
    description: Log in to the system
  - action: navigate
    description: Navigate to products page
    url: /products
  - action: click
    description: Click on first product
    selector: .product-card:first-child
  - action: click
    description: Add to cart
    selector: .add-to-cart-button
  - action: navigate
    description: Go to cart
    url: /cart
  - action: click
    description: Proceed to checkout
    selector: .checkout-button
```

## Reports

Reports are generated in the `reports` directory with both HTML and Markdown formats. The reports include:

- Overall test status and success rate
- Interactive element testing results
- Performance issues
- Responsive design scores
- UI/Accessibility issues
- Recommendations for improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Element not found**: Try adjusting selectors in your flow or waiting for elements to load properly.

2. **Authentication failures**: Ensure credentials are correct and check if the login page has changed.

3. **Browser crashes**: Ensure you have enough system resources and update Playwright with:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade playwright
   playwright install
   ```

4. **Slow tests**: Try running in headless mode for better performance.

## Development

### Project Structure

- `qa_bot.py`: Main QA bot implementation
- `run_qa_bot.py`: Unified command line interface
- `report_generator.py`: HTML and Markdown report generation
- `flow_manager.py`: Custom test flow handling
- `flows/`: Directory containing flow definition files

### Extending the Bot

To add new testing capabilities:

1. Add new test methods to the `QABot` class in `qa_bot.py`
2. Update the report generation in `report_generator.py`
3. Add new actions to the flow system if needed
